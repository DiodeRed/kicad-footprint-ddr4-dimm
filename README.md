# DDR4 DIMM Footprint (KiCad)

This is a KiCad footprint for a DDR4 DIMM module. At present it is untested but I tried to be careful with matching the spec.

Yes, this puts Edge.Cuts layer in a footprint which is generally advised against, but it seemed like the easiest way to make things sensibly usable.
